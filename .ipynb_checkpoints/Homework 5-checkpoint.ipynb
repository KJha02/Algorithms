If you choose not to open a resturant in a location *j*, for instance, then the max-profit you obtain from location *j* is simply the max-profit obtainable from location *j-1*. However, if you choose to open a resturant at location *j*, your max-profit become the expected profit from opening at location *j*, which is *p*[*j*], plus the max-profit from location *p*[*i*], where *i* is the first location that comes before *j* such that locations *j* and *i* are at least *k* miles apart. \n",

    "We also observe that $i_1 \\le i_2 \\le \\dots \\le i_n$, that is, the optimal previous location to open a resturant for the *n*th index is at the (*n* - 1)th location or after. This allows us to compute *c*, an array storing the index of the optimal previous location to open a resturant assuming that you open it in an index *n*.\n",
